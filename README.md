## **Repository Overview**

### **1. Contagious Diseases Simulation**  
**Description:**  
In this assignment I simulated the spread of an epidemic among a population of hosts in a 2D space in C.

### **2. Gas Diffusion Simulation**  
**Description:**  
In this assignment I created a model for the diffusion of a gas particle in a 3D space in C.

### **3. Parallel Program Pipeline (Forks)**  
**Description:**  
In this assignment I utilized Forking to create a program pipeline that executes instructions in parallel in C.

### **3. Producer Consumer problem (Threads)**  
**Description:**  
In this assignment, I utilized threading to address a producer-consumer problem, effectively synchronizing multiple threads to simulate the process of food production and consumption in a fast food restaurant setting.
